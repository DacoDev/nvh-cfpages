<h1>
    Back to Basics Blog
</h1>
<h2>
    Starting back at 0.
</h2>

<p>
    In the past few years, I've used lots of modern technologies, frameworks, and tools to create webapps. I wanted to get back to the basics starting here at plain HTML.
</p>
<p>
    I plan to keep iterations of this site when moving from basic HTML, to HTML with CSS, to HTML with CSS and Vanilla JS, then finally, a full framework with TypeScript like React, Next, etc.
